        <h3>Is finding music hard for you?</h3>

<p>This is a small utility that I developed on my spare time to download songs. Whenever I just wanted to get a song that was in my head, I had to go through several hurdles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remembering to download the song</li>
<li>Searching google for a link</li>
<li>Waiting for long download times</li>
<li>404 pages and missing files</li>
<li>Prohibitive costs</li>
<li>Geo-location barriers to buy Amazon MP3's</li>
</ul><p>Does any of these seem familiar?</p>

<p>That is when I found the website mp3skull.com, where a simple search will find many songs. However, it still suffered from slow page and file download times and missing links. So I started this project, with the aim of creating a <strong>command line utility to download files from mp3skull.com</strong>.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>This script is able to quickly search for songs on mp3skull (via page scraping, since there is no API). It also auto-checks the files and displays only valid links. Furthermore, you can see the bitrate, duration, and file size at a glance. All features have been designed with speed and usability in mind. The file checker will use concurrency to find as many valid links as soon as possible and the nice download prompt is simple and easy to use.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Right now, the only way to install is to clone the git repository and get dependencies by hand using <code>pip</code>. In the future, nicer setup options will be provided.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>This project was developed from scratch by me, Joao Soares (<a href="https://github.com/joaosoares" class="user-mention">@joaosoares</a>). Feel free to fork and contribute!</p>
